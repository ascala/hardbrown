Compiling Instructions
*************************

HardBrown is not meant as a library/utility to be installed, but as 
an educational and research tool. It is therefore meant to compile 
and work in a local directory. Everything is written in C++

The skeletons of Brownian simulation of 2d disks and 3d spheres should 
compile under the requirement that Standard Template Libraries are 
present on your machine.


A standard Makefile allows the compilation of the simulation 
examples BROWNIAN2d.x and BROWNIAN3d.x:

	make allSIMUL

For Ubuntu systems where PlPlot libraries are installed, it is possible 
to compile real-time 2d animated simulations of Brownian and Granular
dynamics:

	make allPLPLOT
 
For Ubuntu systems where Inventor libraries are installed, it is 
possible to compile real-time 3d animated simulations of Newtonian, 
Brownian, Granular dynamics and random growth of bouncing spheres:

	make alINVENTOR
	
If both PlPlot and Inventor are present, it is possible to compile all
real-time animated simulations:

	make allGRAPHIC
 

compiling under UBUNTU:
=======================
Check that the following libraries are installed: 
	* libstlportX.X-dev
(Program have been developed with X.X=5.1, but should not matter)

For 2d graphic, check for:
	* libplplot-dev
	* libplplot-c++
	* plplot9-driver-xwin

For 3d graphic, check for:
	* libinventor
	* inventor-dev
It should be possible to use FreeGlut as an alternative to Inventor
On some Ubuntu systems, it could be also necessary to install
	* freeglut3-dev 

compiling under DEBIAN: 
=======================
Should be similar to Ubuntu


other distribution:
===================
For the real-time animations, it is necessary to modify the 
PLPLOT and INVENTOR flags in the Makefile according to the 
hosting system in order to link PlPlot and Inventor libraries.
