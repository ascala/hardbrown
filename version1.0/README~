This project gives c++ skeletons for the event-driven simulation of the 
Newtonian,  Brownian and Granular dynamics of hard bodies in 2 and 3 
dimensions. 

At the moment, simulations are limited to disks (2d) and spheres (3d)

		OPTIONAL LIBS (GRAPHICS):

plplot (plplot9-driver-xwin, libplplot-dev and libplplot-c++ on 
Ubuntu/Debian)  is required for 2d animation

openinventor and freeglut (inventor-dev, inventor-clients and possibly 
freeglut3-dev on Ubuntu/Debian) are required for 3d animations
