The simulation of hard particles has been longly regarded as a tool for checking idealized theories. Nowadays, Colloidal Science, Granular Matter and Nano Fluidics deal with objects that can be described as hard particles subject to Brownian motion.

While there is a vast choice of simulation tools and libraries for atoms, molecules and in general \char`\"{}soft\char`\"{} particles, this is not the case for \char`\"{}hard\char`\"{} particles. In particular, the standard integration methods for Newtonian and Brownian dynamics are based on the continuity of the inter-particle potential and fail for the steep interactions among hard particles.

Therefore, while simulation methods for systems of many particle have begone a standard in the curriculum of numerical scientists, it is still difficult for them to get an \char`\"{}hand-on\char`\"{} knowledge of hard particles simulations. HardBrown aims to fill such gaps.

For hard particles, it is necessary to resort on Event-Driven simulation methods where the possible collisions among the particles are predicted and then processed through the use of a time-ordered Priority Queue. HardBrown contains programs that can be used as templates for:

\begin{itemize}
\item Event-Driven Newtonian Dynamics\item Event-Driven Granular Dynamics\item Event-Driven Brownian Dynamics\end{itemize}


Both for educational and debugging purposes, it is important to access visually to the ongoing simulation. HardBrown has interfaces and template programs for 2d and 3d real-time animated simulations via PlPlot and Inventor libraries.

HardBrown has been developed on an Ubuntu system, and should therefore be easy to install on Ubuntu and Debian based architecture.

The language chosen is C++.

HardBrown is not meant as a library/utility to be installed, but as an educational and research tool. It is therefore meant to compile and work in a local directory. Everything is written in C++

The skeletons of Brownian simulation of 2d disks and 3d spheres should compile under the requirement that Standard Template Libraries are present on your machine.

A standard Makefile allows the compilation of the simulation examples BROWNIAN2d.x and BROWNIAN3d.x:\begin{itemize}
\item make allSIMUL\end{itemize}


For Ubuntu systems where PlPlot libraries are installed, it is possible to compile real-time 2d animated simulations of Brownian and Granular dynamics:\begin{itemize}
\item make allPLPLOT\end{itemize}


For Ubuntu systems where Inventor libraries are installed, it is possible to compile real-time 3d animated simulations of Newtonian, Brownian, Granular dynamics and random growth of bouncing spheres:\begin{itemize}
\item make alINVENTOR\end{itemize}


If both PlPlot and Inventor are present, it is possible to compile all real-time animated simulations:\begin{itemize}
\item make allGRAPHIC\end{itemize}
\hypertarget{index_compile_ubuntu}{}\subsection{Ubuntu/Debian:}\label{index_compile_ubuntu}
Check that the following libraries are installed:\begin{itemize}
\item libstlportX.X-dev (Program have been developed with X.X=5.1, but should not matter)\end{itemize}


For 2d graphic, check for:\begin{itemize}
\item libplplot-dev\item libplplot-c++\item plplot9-driver-xwin For 3d graphic, check for:\item libinventor\item inventor-dev\end{itemize}


It should be possible to use FreeGlut as an alternative to Inventor On some Ubuntu systems, it could be also necessary to install\begin{itemize}
\item freeglut3-dev\end{itemize}
\hypertarget{index_compile_other}{}\subsection{other distributions:}\label{index_compile_other}
For the real-time animations, it is necessary to modify the PLPLOT and INVENTOR flags in the Makefile according to the hosting system in order to link PlPlot and Inventor libraries.\hypertarget{index_dirs}{}\section{Files:}\label{index_dirs}
