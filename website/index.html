particles has been longly regarded as a tool for checking idealized
theories. Nowadays, Colloidal Science, Granular Matter and Nano Fluidics
deal with objects that can be described as hard particles subject to Brownian motion. <br><br>While
there is a vast choice of simulation tools and libraries for atoms,
molecules and in general "soft" particles, this is not the case for
"hard" particles. In particular, the standard integration methods for
Newtonian and Brownian dynamics are based on the continuity of the
inter-particle potential and fail for the steep interactions among hard
particles. <br><br>Therefore,
while simulation methods for systems of many particle have begone a
standard in the curriculum of numerical scientists, it is still
difficult for them to get an "hand-on" knowledge of hard particles
simulations. <span style="color: red;">HardBrown</span> aims to fill such gaps. <br><br>For
hard particles, it is necessary to resort on Event-Driven simulation
methods where the possible collisions among the particles are predicted
and then processed through the use of a time-ordered Priority Queue. <span style="color: red;">HardBrown</span> contains programs that can be used as templates for:<br><br></div><br><ul><li>Event Driven Newtonian Dynamics</li><li>Event Driven Granular Dynamics</li><li>Event Driven Brownian Dynamics</li></ul><br><div style="text-align: justify;">Both for educational and debugging purposes, it is important to access visually to the ongoing simulation. <span style="color: red;">HardBrown</span> has interfaces and template programs for 2d and 3d real-time animated simulations via PlPlot and Open Inventor libraries. <br><br><span style="color: red;">HardBrown</span> has been developed on an Ubuntu system, and should therefore be easy to install on Ubuntu and Debian based architecture.<br><br>The language chosen is C++. <br></div><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a style="color: rgb(0, 238, 0);" href="http://download.gna.org/hardshap/"><big><big>DOWNLOAD HardBrown</big></big></a><br></div><br><br></body></html>
